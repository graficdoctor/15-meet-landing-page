## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
As usual, I end up making it more complex then I should. I know how easy it us to overload the html and css with `div`'s and classes. So, because I was working on this project over a four-day period (1hour/day), one quickly looses oversight. This shows me I have to deconstruct the project differently to approach it less complex.

I learned how to place images in CSS without overloading the HTML-file which before I used to do.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Centering](https://smolcss.dev/#smol-grid-centering) - I used grid centering to center the `.section-divider`-content. I wrapped the number inside a `span` just like in the example.
- [A FrontEnd Mentor Solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/meet-landing-page-using-flexbox-grid-and-mobile-first-approach-tBOwGZLsZ) - I cheated and had a look in Front End Mentors' Slack to find an example that was slightly going my approach as I was really struggling to place my footer- and hero-images. This solution helped me out.
